## Project Aim

The project's aim was to provide a place consolidate my projects and blog posts into a single website while expermenting with a backend content manager and server hosting. I also wanted to make it headless so I could continue to use React on the frontend. This project will be forever evolving as the oppurtunties are endless on the features that I can add.
